# Bank-Account
Bank Account application used to maintain a bank account balance.


1) Create a BankAccount Class and Form
Create a BankAccount class that can be used to maintain a bank account balance. Include appropriate constructors, properties and methods to enable the account to be originally
created and for amounts to be deposited and withdrawn to/from the account.
Write the NegativeException class to extend the ApplicationException class to include the additional functionality of a new message detailing the error being sent when the
exception is thrown. Throw the NegativeException when a negative value is entered to initially create the account or if a negative value is entered for a deposit or withdrawal.
Include additional exception-handling techniques.
Create a form to use for data entry. Form must check for valid entries.
